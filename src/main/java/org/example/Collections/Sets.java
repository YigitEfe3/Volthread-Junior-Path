/*
*
*   HASHSET CLASS OVERVIEW
*
*   - HashSet can NOT contain duplicate values.
*   - HashSet allows null value
*   - HashSet is an unordered collection. It does not maintain the order in which the elements are inserted.
*   - HashSet internally uses a HashMap to store its elements
*   - HashSet is not thread-safe. If multiple threads try to modify a HashSet at the same time,
*     then the final outcome is not-deterministic. You must explicitly synchronize concurrent access to a HashSet
*   -
