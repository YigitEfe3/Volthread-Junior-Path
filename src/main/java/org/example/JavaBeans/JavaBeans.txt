    PROPERTIES

    - Indexed Properties: An indexed property is an array instead of a single value.
            In this case, the bean class provides a method for getting and setting the entire array.

    - A bean's methods are the things it can do.
            Any public method that is not part of a property definition is a bean method.

    - Bound Properties: A bound property notifies listeners when its value changes. (PropertyChangeSupport)

    - Constrained Properties: A constrained property is a special kind of bound property.
            For a constrained property, the bean keeps track of a set of veto listeners.
            When a constrained property is about to change, the listeners are consulted about the change.
            Any one of the listeners has a chance to veto the change, in which case the property remains unchanged.
            (VetoableChangeSupport)

    BEAN PERSISTENCE

    - A bean has the property of persistence when its properties, fields, and state information are saved to
            and retrieved from storage.

    - The mechanism that makes persistence possible is called serialization. Object serialization means
            converting an object into a data stream and writing it to storage.

    - All beans must persist. To persist, your beans must support serialization by implementing either
            the Serializable or the Externalizable interface.

    - Default serialization will not serialize transient and static fields.

    LONG TERM PERSISTENCE

    - Long-term persistence is a model that enables beans to be saved in XML format.

    What is an XML?

            An XML bean archive has its own specific syntax,
            which includes the following tags to represent each bean element:
                > an XML preamble to describe a version of XML and type of encoding
                > a <java> tag to embody all object elements of the bean
                > an <object> tag to represent a set of method calls needed to reconstruct an object from its serialized form
