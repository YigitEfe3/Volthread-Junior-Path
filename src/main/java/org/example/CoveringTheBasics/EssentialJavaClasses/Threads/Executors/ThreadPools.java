/*
* Thread Pool
*
*       Most of the executor implementations use thread pools, which consists of worker threads.
*       --This kind of thread exists separately from the Runnable and Callable tasks it executes and is often used to execute multiple tasks.
*       --minimizes the overhead dur to thread creation.
*
* Fixed Thread Pool
*
*       Always has a specified number of threads running, if a thread is somehow terminated while it is still in use, it's automatically replaced with a new thread.
