- A web application consists of web components;
    * static resource files, such as images and cascading style sheets (CSS), and
    * helper classes and libraries.

- The web container provides many supporting services that enhance the capabilities of web components and make them easier to develop.

- The process for creating, deploying, and executing a web application can be summarized as follows:

      * Develop the web component code.
      * Develop the web application deployment descriptor, if necessary.
      * Compile the web application components and helper classes referenced by the components.
      * Optionally, package the application into a deployable unit.
      * Deploy the application into a web container.
      * Access a URL that references the web application.
