                            INTERNATIONALIZING AND LOCALIZING WEB APPLICATIONS

- The process of preparing an application to support more than one language and data format is called internationalization.

- Localization is the process of adapting an internationalized application to support a specific region or locale.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOCALIZATION CLASSES

    - java.util.Locale represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region.

    - The string representation of a locale consists of the international standard two-character abbreviation for language and country and an optional variant,
            all separated by underscore (_) characters.

    - Locale-sensitive data is stored in a java.util.ResourceBundle.
            A resource bundle contains key-value pairs, where the keys uniquely identify a locale-specific object in the bundle.

PROVIDING LOCALIZED MESSAGES AND LABELS

    - Messages and labels should be tailored according to the conventions of a user's language and region.
            There are two approaches to providing localized messages and labels in a web application:

        * Provide a version of the web page in each of the target locales and have a controller servlet dispatch the request to the
                appropriate page depending on the requested locale.
                This approach is useful if large amounts of data on a page or an entire web application need to be internationalized.

        * Isolate any locale-sensitive data on a page into resource bundles,
                and access the data so that the corresponding translated message is fetched automatically and inserted into the page.
                Thus, instead of creating strings directly in your code,
                you create a resource bundle that contains translations and read the translations from that bundle using the corresponding key.


    - Establishing the Locale

        * To get the correct strings for a given user, a web application either retrieves the locale from the request using the getLocale method,
                or allows the user to explicitly select the locale.

        * A component can explicitly set the locale by using the fmt:setLocale tag.


    - Setting the Resource Bundle

        * The resource bundle is set with the resource-bundle element in the configuration file.

        * After the locale is set, the controller of a web application could retrieve the resource bundle for that locale and save it as a session attribute
                for use by other components or simply be used to return a text string appropriate for the selected locale

    - Retrieving Localized Messages

        * A web component written in the Java programming language retrieves the resource bundle from the session:
                ResourceBundle messages = (ResourceBundle)session.getAttribute("messages");


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE AND NUMBER FORMATTING

    - Java programs use the DateFormat.getDateInstance(int, locale) method to parse and format dates in a locale-sensitive manner.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHARACTER SETS AND ENCODINGS

    - A character set is a set of textual and graphic symbols, each of which is mapped to a set of nonnegative integers.

    - A character encoding maps a character set to units of a specific width and defines byte serialization and ordering rules.
            Many character sets have more than one encoding.
