CREATING A MANAGED BEAN

    - A managed bean is created with a constructor with no arguments,
                                     a set of properties, and
                                     a set of methods that perform functions for a component.

    - Each of the managed bean properties can be bound to one of the following:

        * A component value
        * A component instance
        * A converter instance
        * A listener instance
        * A validator instance

        These properties follow the conventions of JavaBeans components.


    - The most common functions that managed bean methods perform include the following:

        * Validating a component's data
        * Handling an event fired by a component
        * Performing processing to determine the next page to which the application must navigate

WRITING MANAGED BEAN METHODS       //TODO Managed Bean Method (see Converters,ListenersAndValidators)

    - Methods of a managed bean can perform several application-specific functions for components on the page, including:

        * Performing processing associated with navigation
        * Handling action events
        * Performing validation on the component's value
        * Handling value-change events

    - By using a managed bean to perform these functions, you eliminate the need to implement the Validator interface to handle the validation or
            one of the listener interfaces to handle events.

    - By using a managed bean instead of a Validator implementation to perform validation,
            you eliminate the need to create a custom tag for the Validator implementation.
